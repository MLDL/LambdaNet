This is the source code repo for the [ICLR paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkx6hANtwH) *LambdaNet: Probabilistic Type Inference using Graph Neural Networks*.

After cloning this repo, here are the steps to reproduce our experimental results (todo: provide scripts for these actions):

 - download the Typescript projects used in our experiments
 - filter and prepare the TS projects into a serialization format
 - start the training

Our main results are present in the paper. The Typescript files used for manual comparison with JSNice are put under the directory `data/comparison/`.
